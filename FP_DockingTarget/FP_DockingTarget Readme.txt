-----------------

A COAS style docking target that is automatically added to the center of all standard Clamp-O-Tron docking ports.

Docking Cam
-----------

If you have (or get) the mod Hull Camera VDS you will be able to use a special camera view built into the docking port with a reticle similar to that used by Apollo missions to perform docking in orbit.  ScrollWheel zooms.

MechJeb may be used to supply the rendezvous data or you can do it all visually. :)

Installation
------------

Copy to your KSP installation's directory as with all mods.

License can be found in the part directory (folder).
